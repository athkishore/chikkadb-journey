ChikkaDB is envisaged as a mongod-compatible server application, which you can connect to using any of your favourite MongoDB clients or language drivers. The plan is to use SQLite as the storage backend.

This repository contains companion source code to a series of blog posts documenting the journey in building ChikkaDB.
